    1 My Journey
    2
    3 Born and raised in Ukraine, I embarked on my journey in the area of Information Technology.
    4 Fueled by a passion for innovation and problem-solving, I pursued studies in IT technologies,
    5 specializing in computer technology management and education at Lutsk National Technical University.
    6
    7 As a firm believer in the power of education, I dedicated a portion of my career to teaching programming
    8 and basic algorithms in schools. It was immensely rewarding to inspire the next generation of tech enthusiasts.
    9
   10 Seeking new challenges, I transitioned into the corporate world and took on the role of a System Administrator
   11 at Atlanta, a company deeply immersed in the fields of investing and trading. 
   12 During my time there, I honed my skills in server management, network design and security system implementation.
   13
   14 In 2015, my journey took me to Spain, where I continued my pursuit of knowledge. 
   15 I joined the 42 community, first in Madrid and later in Malaga. At 42, I delved into the world of C/C++, participated
   16 in various projects, and embraced a peer-to-peer learning methodology, that enriched my understanding of software development.
   17 Since 2022, I have been contributing as IT/PEDAGOGUE staff at 42, working closely with students and fostering an environment of 
   18 collaborative learning and growth.
   19
   20 Living at the intersection of technology and creativity, my journey is an ongoing exploration of the vast possibilities that 
   21 the IT world offers. From the classrooms of Ukraine to the bustling tech hubs of Spain, 
   22 I am fueled by a continuous desire to learn, grow and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
